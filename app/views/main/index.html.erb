		  <p>Hey! My name is Raji Ayinla. Four years ago, I was too busy burying my head in The Visual Starter Guides for HTML/CSS, PHP, and Javascript to even fathom that Iâ€™d ever know how to style a navigation bar properly, let alone build a site from scratch. </p>
	      <p>Now, I have a wide array of skills that start at the front end with languages like HTML,CSS, and Javascript, ending at the back end with knowledge that includes Ruby, the Ruby on Rails framework, and a bit of PHP.

From the state to the local level, users will also be able to see upcoming policies that will be voted on by their representative as well as how they have voted on past policies.</p>
